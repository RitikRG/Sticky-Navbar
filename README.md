# Sticky-Navbar
This is sticky navbar that changes it's color scheme at a certain scroll level. I made this using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and as always I got the idea to make this from JavaScript King, but with this project I learned a lot more new things like how the scroll event is used with the window.
